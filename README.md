This is a basic Solidity contract for managing an ERC20 token. Here's what it does:

Key Features:

It has two mappings to store balances and allowances.
The total supply of the token is set to 10000 * 10^18 (1 billion tokens).
Two events are defined: Transfer and Approval.
Functions:

balanceOf(address owner): Returns the balance of a specific address.
transfer(address to, uint value): Transfers a certain amount from one account to another. It checks if the sender has enough funds before executing the transfer.
transferFrom(address from, address to, uint value): Similar to transfer, but it also takes into account an allowance set by the owner for a spender (e.g., a smart contract).
approve(address spender, uint value): Sets an allowance for another account (spender) to spend tokens on behalf of this one.
Note: This is just a basic example and you should consider security best practices when deploying your own token.
